My current project concerns the Small Alarmone Synthetases (SASs), a family of proteins that includes Enterococcus faecalis RelQ, a protein recently found to have RNA-binding activity (Beljantseva et al, 2017). The cellular RNA targets of RelQ are currently unknown, but we are addressing this question in collaboration with the lab of Vasili Hauryliuk in UmeÌ´ using a next generation sequencing method called CRAC (UV cross-linkingåÊand analysis of cDNA). With this method, RelQ-bound RNA fragments are protected from RNase degradation, cDNA libraries generated from the RNA footprints are sequenced, and the interaction sites are mapped back to the genome. As a bioinformatics PhD student, I will be doing the data analysis part of the project, which has extensive overlaps with the data analysis required for ChIP-Seq experiments. I have previous experience in working with NGS data; as part of my MSc in Bioinformatics I analyzed exome-captured sequencing data, using different bioinformatics programs, GATK pipeline, Python scripting and R. ReferencesBeljantseva J, Kudrin P, Andresen L, Shingler V, Atkinson GC, Tenson T, Hauryliuk V (2017) Negative allosteric regulation of Enterococcus faecalis small alarmone synthetase RelQ by single-stranded RNA.

The gene expression programs that define various cell types are initiated by transcription factors and lead to cell specification. Maintenance of this cell type specific gene expression in differentiated cells involves epigenetic mechanisms, but how epigenetic patterns are initially established during embryo development is poorly understood in all organisms. To address this, our lab utilizing the well-studied dorso-ventral patterning of Drosophila embryo, recently showed how Dorsal, a sequence specific transcription factor which belongs to highly conserved Rel/NFkë_ family, uses the CBP histone acetyltransferase and the Polycomb histone methyltransferase to establish different chromatin states at a single locus in three germlayers (Boija A, Mannervik M., 2016). In this study, we will extend these findings to a genome-wide level by mapping histone H3, H3K27 acetylation and H3K27 tri-methylation in 4 genotypes, i.e. embryos consisting of naÌøve (pluripotent) cells, entirely of presumptive mesoderm, neuroectoderm or dorsal ectoderm. To accurately normalize the ChIP-seq signal between these tissues, we have included spike-in chromatin from a different Drosophila species. These experiments will reveal if there are common mechanisms of establishing epigenetic differences in the three germlayers.Reference Boija A, Mannervik M.

We have a set of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data for several insulators proteins for wild type and two mutant cell lines (CTCF minus and CP190 minus cell lines). We also have a Hi-C data for the corresponding cell lines.
